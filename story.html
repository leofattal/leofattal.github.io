        <h1>How Earth Was Created and Why It's the Perfect Planet</h1>

        <p>There used to only be planets that were too hot or too cold and no perfect planet. At the end of the string of planets that make our galaxy was a cold hard lump of rock just behind Pluto called ‘Earthia’. Earthia was, believe it or not, inhabited by life forms known as earthians - the prehistoric version of what we more commonly know as humans or people. Every morning, the earthians got up gloomily from their mats made from rock and dust and walked over to the temple to pray to the Great Glass Fish only to find, disappointed, that their prayers didn't get answered. Only one earthian child in the entire population of earthians believed in the Great Glass Fish more than anyone, and his name was <span class="highlight">Earth Humanius Pepleius</span>.</p>

        <p>In the mornings, he prayed for a bigger, better planet. In the afternoon, he prayed for something to make his throat feel better after he ate his rocky meals (that were actually made from rock) and in the evening, he always prayed to meet the Great Glass Fish for real and ask him to grant his wishes. Earth never gave up on his wishes and prayed every day, consistently, always ignoring what others thought about him. One day, the other child earthians couldn't stand how happy Earth was and how weird he was, so they cooked up a malicious plan to get rid of him…</p>

        <p>At exactly 7:26, Earth started praying to the Great Glass Fish. When he finished praying for a better planet to live on, the gang of ‘<span class="important">BAD EGGS</span>’ caught up to Earth. The gang told him that they found a diamond in a little bowl near the deepest crater in Earthia. Earth, trapped in his little world of magic, of course fell for the trick and ended up in a rocky catapult that was ready for launch. The BAD EGGS shoved Earth into the bowl and while doing so, they slammed his head against the rock. Earth’s vision went lopsided and the last thing he felt was his limp body being thrown into the vacuum of space.</p>

        <p>Earth woke up on a cold frosty planet that he later recognized as Neptune. As he trekked in the snow, he couldn't help but wonder what he did to deserve this punishment. The icy temperatures of Neptune were making him really cold and Earth started shivering really hard. There was another reason for this uncontrollable shivering too, the thought of dying here cold, hungry, hopeless and alone started haunting him when the sky grew darker. Suddenly, he felt as if his knee became frozen on the inside. He dropped to the ground, startled, the reality of his thoughts coming true. The pain was gripping him, it felt like a spiky fish was flopping around in his leg. After several minutes sitting on his knees in the constantly rising snow, he remembered something.</p>

        <p>‘Fish…fish,’ Earth thought, as he racked his brain for a memory.</p>
        
        <p>‘Aha! The Great Glass Fish!’ Earth, who couldn't move or speak because of his frozen lips and legs, used his arms and hip to clear the snow away from his legs and started praying. When he was done, Earth looked around hopefully to find that nothing had changed except for the increasing snow. He sighed. Maybe the other earthians were right. The Great Glass Fish was probably just a hoax. Then, just after he had finished grumbling about the injustices of life, he felt a warming sensation in his knee. It was satisfying to feel all this warmth in a time this cold. Earth sighed happily. But the happiness didn't last for long. The heat seemed to be leaving him. Earth shook his legs and focused all his strength on the jog ahead of him. That seemed to do the trick, but if he stopped, the golden mist would drift away. Soon, Earth was so caught up in his chase that he didn't realize he was going to run straight down a cliff. Luckily, as soon as his toes stretched over the void, he made a gesture that let him regain his balance. While he was still recovering from the shock of what just happened, a great gust of wind blew him off balance and caused him to glide across the ice strait off the cliff. In another lucky turn of events, he managed to grab onto an icy rock. But then, his fingers started to go numb. Earth was hanging on with all his might, but the warmth of his hands was causing the ice to melt. His fingers slipped away, one by one, and then, with one last failed effort at trying to hold on, he fell. The rushing air was painful in his eyes as he fell to his death. Bracing himself for impact, he closed his eyes, but then something magical happened. After Earth had almost collided with the ground, a beautiful fish built with diamonds swam out of nowhere and let Earth float gracefully to the ground. Not believing what he saw, he rubbed his eyes several times to see that nothing changed.</p>

        <p>The fish swam towards him. In a loud booming voice that shook the icicles around them, the sparkling fish said “What causes you to come here and disturb my rest, young child?”</p>

        <p>Earth, eyes still open wide in disbelief, bent down on his knees painfully and bowed down to the Great Glass Fish while saying, “Oh, mighty Glass Fish, you have all my respects. Please do what you have to do,” Earth got up with his arms stretched out wide. “Please continue with me. I come here in search of a granted wish.”</p>

        <p>The Great Glass Fish swam over to him and said “Take this moonstone from my crown. It will let me know if you are worthy of a granted wish. Press it to your forehead and say this while doing so, ‘Atrium Spectora!’” As the fish said this, her eyes glowed blue and Earth felt his head jump like it was being scanned. “I will say this after you say it so I can look into your mind through the moonstone. If you don't say the spell, I can get a false sense of thought and it won't work out.”</p>

        <p>Earth nodded slowly and opened his mouth to repeat the spell. “AAAH! NO! The moonstone has not pressed upon your forehead and you need to practice the spell too! Try saying it first.” said the fish, calming down.</p>

        <p>“Ok,” said Earth automatically. “Uh, Atrium Spectora!” he recited, with a great accent.</p>

        <p>“No, Atrium Spectora!” said the great fish again.</p>

        <p>“Let me try again, Atrium Spectora!” Earth cried.</p>

        <p>“Almost, but with a greater curl of your tongue.” instructed the Great Glass Fish.</p>

        <p>More confident than ever, Earth put the moonstone to his forehead and repeated loud and clearly “Atrium Spectora!”</p>

        <p>There was a loud crack of thunder and Earth heard the spell being repeated. The moonstone started to warm up, he felt like he was being pulled into the sky. Earth saw flashes of his baby life and images of him praying before the burning hot moonstone ended the light that he still could see through his closed eyes.</p>

        <p>SSSSsssssss! That was the first sound that Earth heard when he woke up. He sat up and saw the glittering fish magicking water over to the moonstone while looking really surprised.</p>

        <p>“Ah. You're awake. The moonstone only grows hot when it sees a person worthy of a granted wish. It has been 100,000 years since the moonstone has ever grown hot.”</p>

        <p>“Huh?” asked Earth hazily.</p>

        <p>“Follow me. Your wish will be granted.” said the Great Glass Fish.</p>

        <p>Earth jumped up immediately and asked “How far do we have to walk?”</p>

        <p>“Ahhh, no. We will be teleporting there.” the sparkling fish bellowed.</p>

        <p>The fish conjured a purple, glowing bubble of water and with a whip of his tail, the crackling bubble of water instantly transported Earth to a temple that looked like a fish. A second later, the great fish appeared.</p>

        <p>“Please don't mind that absolutely disgustingly built fish tail back there.” said the Great Glass Fish, pointing to a soggy looking fish tail made from ice at the back of the temple.</p>
    
        <p>“Uh, ok.” replied Earth.</p>
    
        <p>“Now follow me into the temple please.” called the fish as she swam towards the castle.</p>
    
        <p>Earth did as he was told and followed the fish. The only thing Earth did when he took his first few steps into the temple was take in the beauty of it. There were ice sculptures and glass chandeliers. In the middle of this enormous temple, there was a diamond-covered throne with a shallow moat around it.</p>
    
        <p>“Now start praying as if you were in Earthia.” commanded the great fish.</p>
    
        <p>Earth got down on his knees and started to pray. Then he felt a strong wind blow across his face. When he looked up, he saw the fish trapped in a glowing whirlpool of her moat’s water. The wind slowly died down after five minutes and when the water cleared, a beautiful girl stood in the fish's place with her eyes closed. Suddenly, the fish girl’s eyes opened revealing a pair of glowing blue eyes.</p>
    
        <p>“Stay behind.” she aimed her eyes at the end of her temple, the fish tail of the structure.</p>
    
        <p>“But, you're gonna destroy your own temple!” exclaimed Earth.</p>
    
        <p>“I've always been looking for an excuse to destroy that sucky fish tail.” she grinned.</p>
    
        <p>Then the fish girl took a deep breath and started shooting diamonds, emeralds, and all kinds of other gems from her eyes.</p>
    
        <p>Earth saw the wall blocking her path explode and he watched the stream of jewels make their way to Earthia and stick to the rocky mass. Soon, the whole planet was covered with shimmering objects.</p>
    
        <p>“I'll teleport you back there. Wish them to get teleported here and then walk over to the deepest crater there. Jump in there and I'll teleport my moonstone to you. Start reciting your wishes and…”</p>
    
        <p>Earth gulped. “And what?” he asked nervously.</p>
    
        <p>“...you,” she hesitated. “You die.”</p>
    
        <p>Earth gasped. “Just one question. Will it hurt?”</p>
    
        <p>“No.” the fish girl lied.</p>
    
        <p>“Ok. I would like a painless death, and I'll die knowing I created a better future for my fellow earthians,” Earth concluded.</p>
    
        <p>“Now teleport me!” he cried.</p>
    
        <p>The purple bubble reappeared and then he was back on a diamond-covered Earthia.</p>
    
        <p>“GUYS!” he bellowed. “THE GREAT GLASS FISH WILL EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU. BUT FIRST, I NEED YOU TO HUDDLE UP IN FRONT OF ME!”</p>
    
        <p>The earthians did as told, still scared about the sudden attack of jewels. ‘I wish all earthians could be teleported to The Great Glass Fish’s temple!’ Earth mind-wished. With a loud crack, the earthians disappeared. With a deep breath, he set off to find the deepest crater of Earthia. When he reached his destination, he savored the last bit of life he had before jumping into the endless pit. Earth bent his legs and made himself jump into the crater. BOOM. His feet touched the ground. Not caring about the surprise, he bent down on his knees and started praying for the moonstone to come. Crack! It appeared in his hand. He pressed it to his forehead and held his breath as he wished for the new life he would never live to see. The moonstone started to heat up and it burned his skin. It was starting to melt. Earth had already fainted. The moonstone continued to melt and hardened into a hot, glowing red orb. The finished magic sent a ripple through the air. The fish girl sensed it and covered the crater with some remaining jewels. She was sure she had placed Earth in the middle of the planet.</p>
    
        <p>When nothing happened, her face fell. She had taken someone's life for a wish and it wasn't working. Suddenly the gem-covered planet exploded with light, it broke the chains of the sun and sped forwards until it found the perfect spot to be controlled by the sun again. The diamonds melted into the oceans and rivers now existing, the emeralds became land and the rubies, lava. The red, glowing ball containing Earth inside it became the core of the earth.</p>
    
        <p>Then, with a last bit of magic, the fish girl turned herself back into the Great Glass Fish, teleported the hairy lumps of stupidity to the new planet that had just been formed called Earth as dinosaurs and froze herself in her throne again waiting for someone worthy of a granted wish.</p>
